# AtliQ-hospitality-analysis
As a part of my studies, I have built a dashboard in Power BI to analyze three months sales data of different AtliQ hotels across four different cities.

# Problemm statement
Atliq Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, Atliq Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of Atliq Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” in order to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them insights from their historical data.

# Things learned
> Tried using color palette and stick with that colors throughout the dashboard.
> Created new table to store all measures that will make everything organised.
> By referring different cancellation polices followed by different hotels, understood that most of the hotels charge zero fee, only if the booking is cancelled before three months of booking date. If the booking is cancelled after that, the charge range from 60 to 90% of the booking cost.

# Some important insights from dashboard
> When comparing AtliQ Exotica to all seven types of properties, it performs better with 320 million in revenue, a rating of 3.62, an occupancy percentage of 57, and a cancellation rate of 24.4%.
> Delhi leads in terms of rating and occupancy, followed by Hyderabad, Mumbai, and Bangalore.
> Mumbai generates the highest revenue (669 M) followed by Bangalore, Hyderabad and Delhi
> AtliQ Bay has the greatest occupancy rate, at 66%.
> The majority of bookings and the highest cancellation rate are for elite-class accommodations.
